Now it could either go to right side point at distance 3 or the point -1 to the left of 0. both are of same distance and if we have not broken for tie, the robot could hip-hop between left and right unnecessarily increasing the distance.

    "A different idea could be to connect two endpoint pairs which are shortest but do not terminate prematurely the cycle before reaching the final point and coming back to point 0. \\\n",
    "Basically, we start with each vertex as vertex chains. then from each vertex, we pick end points and compute distances to those end points. IF distance is less than already set distance of d, then connect them with an edge and make that vertex part of the vertex chain. This way , keep growing vertex chains and finally there will be one vertex chain which reaches teh end point.
