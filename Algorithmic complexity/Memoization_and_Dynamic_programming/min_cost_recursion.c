/*
You want to buy apples, so you go to an apple store.
The store has a price for buying one appleâ€”for example, $1.75. 
The store also has m pricing schemes, where each pricing scheme gives a number n and a price p for buying n apples.
For example, one pricing scheme might state that three apples cost a total of $4.00.
another might state that two apples cost a total of $2.50. 
You want to buy at least k apples and to do so as cheaply as possible.
