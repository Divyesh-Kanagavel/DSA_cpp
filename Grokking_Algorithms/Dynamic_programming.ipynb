    "for the same knapsack problem with three items guitar [1lb and 1500$], stereo [4lb and 3000$], laptop [3lb and 2000$], we construct a grid with rows indicating the item and columns indicating the weight of knapsacks [increasing from lowest weight 1lb to max weight 4lb] . the idea is if subproblem are solved, they can be used in higher level of problems. we start populating the grid starting from first item till all items are analyzed. the formula for filling the grid is: \\\n",
