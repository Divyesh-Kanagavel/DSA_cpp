    "The ideal trade would be to get LP for 5 dollars and then get poster and getting 7 dollars in return and then buying drums which would cost him 33 dollars .But if we apply Dijkstra's,  we would first get to cheaptest node, which is poster since it does not cost anything. the other nearest node to book is LP which costs 5 dollars. the poster has a neighbor , drums -> so update its cost to 35. now, the next cheapest node  is LP, which costs 5. after reaching LP, the poster is one of the neighbors, so the path to poster can be updated as 5-7=2 dollars. but Dijkstra's does not work that way. the node poster has already been processed, so it is not visited anymore. Hence it will select the path, book->poster->drum for 35 dollars. \n"

Bellman Ford can thus determine the presence of negative cycles.\n",

The final relaxation Nth one, helps find negative cycles, if we relax once more and there is reduction in cost, then there exists a negative cycle.\n"
